### Hi, Iâ€™m Mark Van Rietema. 
- I am a Restoration ecologist working for an environmental consulting company called Olberding Environmental, Inc.
- I have been learing to program (mostly in python and data science) as a hobby over the last few years. I have an intrest in data and experimentation from my background in biology, and it turns out there is a whole world of data analytics that I knew nothing about. I am continuing to learn and use what I have learned to apply to my current work in restoration ecology.
