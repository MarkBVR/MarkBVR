### Hi, I’m Mark Van Rietema. 
- I had dabbled in programming a bit over the past few years, but like many I had a lot of extra time on my hands this past year. I used much of that time to learn python more seriously. I have an intrest in data and experimentation from my background in biology, and it turns out there is a whole would of data analytics that I knew nothing about. I’m currently looking for my first job in the field of data analysis.
